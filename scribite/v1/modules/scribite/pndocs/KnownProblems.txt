scribite! runs fine without any problems in most conditions.

But sometimes i might be hard to get the scripts to work.
This file describes known problems.

1. Dynamenu and other javascripts loaded "onload"
   Dynamenu loads with "body-onload" also xinha does.
   Problem is described here:
    eng: http://community.postnuke.com/module-Forum-viewtopic-topic-51106-highlight-xinha.htm
    deu: http://support.pn-cms.de/module-CMS_Support_Forum-viewtopic-topic-25140-start-0.htm

2. xinha plugins making problems and should be deleted/deactivated
 - CharCounter
   User report that they only can type 1000 chars in textarea when this plugin is activated
 - FullPage
   Generates "full" html pages - which is not necessary in postnuke!
