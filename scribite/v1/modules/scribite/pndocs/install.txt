Version for pn.764

Upgrade from xinha (scribite! is the successor of xinha module):
################################################################

Please deactivate and remove xinha from module-administration and 
completely delete xinha-folder.

Then install scribite! as described below.

If you have modified your templates, please backup the related files.


Installation:
#############

Since version 1.2 of scribite! the scripts are located in pnroot/javascript/scribite_editors/, the old folder scribite/pnincludes should be deleted.

If you changed some config files from plugins you have to backup these and set new config in new folders.

1. Copy the scribite folder to your Postnuke's modules folder, regenerate the 
   modules list in the admin panel, initialize and activate it.

2. Copy modules/scribite/pntemplates/plugins/function.scribite.php to your
   modules/Xanthia/plugins folder or your theme-specific-plugins folder.

3. Copy the folder scribite_editors into the javascript folder in pnroot.
   
4. Clear cache-folders (should be done in module-init, but deleting twice is to be sure ;) ):
   pnTemp/Xanthia_compiled
   pnTemp/Xanthia_cache
   pnTemp/pnRender_compiled
   pnTemp/pnRender_cache
   
5. Read modules.txt if you want to use scribite! with Settings, FAQ, Reviews 
   or Sections from pn.762-core or some other external modules.
   Since pn.764 the core modules work without any change
   
6. Edit your your theme templates (!!IMPORTANT!!):

   - Xanthia Themes:
     <... some code ...>
     <!--[scribite]-->
     </head>
     <body>
     <... more code ...>
    
     In a few cases <!--[ scribite ]--> seems not to work, so use above call without spaces.

   - Legacy themes:
     $scribite = pnModFunc('scribite', 'user', 'editorheader');
     echo ($scribite);
    
   - Autothemes:
    Add the following to your theme.html
     <head>
      <?php $scribite = pnModFunc('scribite', 'user', 'editorheader');
      echo $scribite ?>
     </head>
    
    You must disable the strip head option in the settings of the Autotheme and then the correct include will be done in your Autotheme theme. 

7. Edit permissions. scribite! needs at least COMMENT rights!

8. Go to Administration/scribite, activate your favorite editor and select modules and 
   plugins and some other settings.
   
9. Have fun ;)
